A little modification of the original warmod  
Original warmod forum link: https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=225474

# Features
- Recognize the game mode of csgo server automatically change the config settings (modified the settings about the default config)

# Problems
- In warmod's config, you have to remove the stuff about `mp_maxrounds` and make sure the server config has `mp_maxrounds`
